hi I'm Henry a driver instructor here at Schneider today I'll be walking you through how to fill out a logbook as a truck driver before we get into filling out a log book I think it's important to first discuss what it is a log book is a recordkeeping document that truck drivers use to track their time spend working and not working some of the key information you'll find on a log book page includes the date it's recorded at the top of the log page we keep track of the time as well each log page covers a 24-hour period which is divided by vertical lines each hour is printed across the top of the grid area and each hour is broken down into 15-minute increments by short vertical lines there are four horizontal rows in the grid area and each row represents one of the four Duty statuses a driver falls under the four statuses are line one which includes all time a driver is not driving or performing other job related duties line two which includes all time a driver spends in their sleeper birth remember that sleeper birth is a location not an activity line three which includes all time a driver spends driving or sitting at the controls of a commercial motor vehicle and line four which includes all time a driver is doing non-driving work the remark section is where a driver records the city and state of each change and Duty St status along with the city and state a driver also records specific information about what they were doing such as a pre- impost trip inspection inroad truck inspections loading and unloading Freight changing trailers and fueling their truck so let's walk through entering one of these logs first thing we're going to do is put today's date in then your driver number your initials your signature and in this case we don't have a code driver so we're going to put na or not applicable and Green Bay Wisconsin happens to be the home Operating Center of this driver so he's going to enter his tractor number his trailer number and in this case at the end of the day he doesn't have any other trailers we're going to enter the shipper information for Don's Paper Company the commodity is paper products and we've got a load ID every company might be different but that's what we do here at Schneider na we didn't have any other the load that day so we put Naas for that let's get started on actually filling out the timeline so we're going to put a little Dot and I've used here just to help you see it a little bit better but in this case we've done it at 6:30 so he starts his day at 6:30 and draws a line from the left to the right to connect the dot then he's going to change his duty status from off duty in line number one to on duty on line number four and connect the lines because we changed Duty status we actually have to add a flag or a notation in the remark section as to what we're doing and where we're doing it so we're going to add a little 45Â° Mark add green B Wisconsin and in this case he's doing a pre-trip and a ti ti stands for trailer Integrity verification he's going to do that pre-trip in half an hour and then he's immediately going to put himself back up into the drive line but before he can do that he's got to Mark the fact that he did not move the truck from when he started his day until just before he started driving and we're going to do that with what's called a bracket so if you watch that little bar on the bottom there get extended over to the left and create what basically looks like a cup that's called a bracket it just denotes the section of time where he didn't move the truck now we're going to go to drive so he's simply going to put a dot up there connect the line and off he goes to drive when he stops the truck later on he's got to stop and scale the load that he has he's going to stop go back to on duty and in this case we were in Fondulac Wisconsin to do that scaling at a cat scale spent a half an hour doing that maybe stopped and got himself something to drink as well so he's on duty now he's going to go back to driving and we also bracketed that section so that we knew the truck didn't move in Fondulac for half an hour goes back to drive and he drives until 1:00 in the afternoon so again I just use those little dots to help us remember where we are on the timeline at 1:00 he's going to take his 30 minute break so he's going to go up to line number one off duty he's connect the lines spends a half an hour on what is his 30-minute break in pawpaw Illinois remember you have to mark your location as well as what you're doing when you change your duty status he's there for half an hour goes back down to driving and then he's going to drive until 5:30 in the afternoon and he's going to stop in Edwardsville Illinois to do his post-trip TI and start his 10-hour break again he's going to put himself back to off duty he's going to spend a little bit of time an hour and a half in off duty status and then because he has changed the location in his truck and he's actually in the sleeper birth he's going to move his status down to line number two sleeper birth where he will spend the rest of the night one of the things we have to keep track of is how many miles we drove each day and in this case the total driving miles is entered up there next to the trailer number and we're going to put in 472 miles for his day as it turns out he didn't have a Cod driver so the total truck miles for that day is the same 472 mil now we've got to keep track of how much time we spent on each one of these Duty status lines so on line number one we count up the blocks including the half hour blocks and we total it up in this case it's 8 hours and 30 minutes we spent 5 hours in the sleeper birth and we spent 9 hours and 30 minutes driving and finally we spent only a half an hour on each section there so a total of an hour of on duty time and hopefully that always totals up to 24 hours now we have to keep track of how many hours of driving and how much on duty time we have and in this case 9 hours and 30 minutes plus an hour equals 10 hours and 30 minutes in this case we're going to write it down as a digital equivalent or 10.5 hours and circle it we hope this demonstration has helped you learn about the process of filling out a log book remember maintain accurate records isn't just a legal requirement it's also an essential part of ensuring
