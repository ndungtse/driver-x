00:13 hi I'm Henry a driver instructor here at
00:15 Schneider today I'll be walking you
00:17 through how to fill out a logbook as a
00:19 truck driver before we get into filling
00:21 out a log book I think it's important to
00:22 first discuss what it is a log book is a
00:25 recordkeeping document that truck
00:26 drivers use to track their time spend
00:28 working and not working some of the key
00:30 information you'll find on a log book
00:32 page includes the date it's recorded at
00:35 the top of the log page we keep track of
00:37 the time as well each log page covers a
00:39 24-hour period which is divided by
00:42 vertical lines each hour is printed
00:44 across the top of the grid area and each
00:46 hour is broken down into 15-minute
00:48 increments by short vertical lines there
00:51 are four horizontal rows in the grid
00:53 area and each row represents one of the
00:55 four Duty statuses a driver falls under
00:57 the four statuses are line one which
01:00 includes all time a driver is not
01:02 driving or performing other job related
01:04 duties line two which includes all time
01:07 a driver spends in their sleeper birth
01:08 remember that sleeper birth is a
01:10 location not an activity line three
01:13 which includes all time a driver spends
01:15 driving or sitting at the controls of a
01:17 commercial motor vehicle and line four
01:20 which includes all time a driver is
01:22 doing non-driving
01:24 work the remark section is where a
01:26 driver records the city and state of
01:29 each change and Duty St status along
01:31 with the city and state a driver also
01:33 records specific information about what
01:35 they were doing such as a pre- impost
01:38 trip inspection inroad truck inspections
01:41 loading and unloading Freight changing
01:43 trailers and fueling their truck so
01:46 let's walk through entering one of these
01:47 logs first thing we're going to do is
01:49 put today's date in then your driver
01:52 number your
01:53 initials your
01:55 signature and in this case we don't have
01:57 a code driver so we're going to put na
01:59 or not applicable and Green Bay
02:01 Wisconsin happens to be the home
02:02 Operating Center of this driver so he's
02:05 going to enter his tractor number his
02:08 trailer number and in this case at the
02:10 end of the day he doesn't have any other
02:11 trailers we're going to enter the
02:13 shipper information for Don's Paper
02:15 Company the commodity is paper products
02:17 and we've got a load ID every company
02:19 might be different but that's what we do
02:20 here at Schneider na we didn't have any
02:22 other the load that day so we put Naas
02:24 for that let's get started on actually
02:26 filling out the timeline so we're going
02:28 to put a little Dot and I've used here
02:30 just to help you see it a little bit
02:32 better but in this case we've done it at
02:33 6:30 so he starts his day at 6:30 and
02:36 draws a line from the left to the right
02:39 to connect the dot then he's going to
02:41 change his duty status from off duty in
02:43 line number one to on duty on line
02:46 number four and connect the lines
02:49 because we changed Duty status we
02:51 actually have to add a flag or a
02:53 notation in the remark section as to
02:55 what we're doing and where we're doing
02:56 it so we're going to add a little 45Â°
02:58 Mark add green B Wisconsin and in this
03:01 case he's doing a pre-trip and a ti ti
03:05 stands for trailer Integrity
03:07 verification he's going to do that
03:08 pre-trip in half an hour and then he's
03:11 immediately going to put himself back up
03:13 into the drive line but before he can do
03:15 that he's got to Mark the fact that he
03:17 did not move the truck from when he
03:18 started his day until just before he
03:21 started driving and we're going to do
03:23 that with what's called a bracket so if
03:25 you watch that little bar on the bottom
03:27 there get extended over to the left and
03:28 create what basically looks like a cup
03:30 that's called a bracket it just denotes
03:32 the section of time where he didn't move
03:34 the truck now we're going to go to drive
03:37 so he's simply going to put a dot up
03:38 there connect the line and off he goes
03:41 to drive when he stops the truck later
03:44 on he's got to stop and scale the load
03:46 that he has he's going to stop go back
03:50 to on
03:51 duty and in this case we were in
03:53 Fondulac Wisconsin to do that scaling at
03:56 a cat scale spent a half an hour doing
03:59 that maybe stopped and got himself
04:00 something to drink as well so he's on
04:03 duty now he's going to go back to
04:05 driving and we also bracketed that
04:08 section so that we knew the truck didn't
04:09 move in Fondulac for half an hour goes
04:12 back to drive and he drives until 1:00
04:15 in the afternoon so again I just use
04:18 those little dots to help us remember
04:20 where we are on the timeline at 1:00
04:23 he's going to take his 30 minute break
04:24 so he's going to go up to line number
04:26 one off
04:28 duty he's connect the lines spends a
04:31 half an hour on what is his 30-minute
04:33 break in pawpaw Illinois remember you
04:35 have to mark your location as well as
04:37 what you're doing when you change your
04:39 duty status he's there for half an
04:42 hour goes back down to
04:45 driving and then he's going to drive
04:47 until 5:30 in the afternoon and he's
04:50 going to stop in Edwardsville Illinois
04:52 to do his post-trip TI and start his
04:55 10-hour break again he's going to put
04:58 himself back to off duty
05:00 he's going to spend a little bit of time
05:02 an hour and a half in off duty status
05:04 and then because he has changed the
05:06 location in his truck and he's actually
05:08 in the sleeper birth he's going to move
05:10 his status down to line number two
05:12 sleeper birth where he will spend the
05:14 rest of the night one of the things we
05:16 have to keep track of is how many miles
05:17 we drove each day and in this case the
05:20 total driving miles is entered up there
05:22 next to the trailer number and we're
05:24 going to put in 472 miles for his day as
05:27 it turns out he didn't have a Cod driver
05:30 so the total truck miles for that day is
05:32 the same 472 mil now we've got to keep
05:36 track of how much time we spent on each
05:38 one of these Duty status lines so on
05:40 line number one we count up the blocks
05:42 including the half hour blocks and we
05:44 total it up in this case it's 8 hours
05:47 and 30
05:48 minutes we spent 5 hours in the sleeper
05:51 birth and we spent 9 hours and 30
05:54 minutes driving and finally we spent
05:57 only a half an hour on each section
05:59 there so a total of an hour of on duty
06:02 time and hopefully that always totals up
06:04 to 24 hours now we have to keep track of
06:08 how many hours of driving and how much
06:09 on duty time we have and in this case 9
06:12 hours and 30 minutes plus an hour equals
06:15 10 hours and 30 minutes in this case
06:17 we're going to write it down as a
06:19 digital equivalent or 10.5 hours and
06:22 circle it we hope this demonstration has
06:25 helped you learn about the process of
06:27 filling out a log book remember maintain
06:30 accurate records isn't just a legal
06:32 requirement it's also an essential part
06:34 of ensuring your safety on the road as
